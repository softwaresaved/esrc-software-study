# Introduction

The aim of this document is to give an overview of expenditure done by the UKRI ESRC as determined from a [Gateway to Research](https://gtr.ukri.org/) (GtR) data set, made available under an [Open Government Licence](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/), which covers the period `r format(min(gtrdat$StartDate),"%d/%m/%y")` to `r format(max(gtrdat$EndDate, na.rm = TRUE),"%d/%m/%y")`. The GtR data snapshot was downloaded from the GtR website on the 11/10/21 and was last updated by UKRI on the 30th of September 2021. The R markdown should also work on any future updates.

The data set contains `r format(nrow(gtrdat), big.mark = ",")` rows (after some data cleaning), where a row can be interpreted as the record of an award. In this data set `r format(nrow(gtrdat[gtrdat$FundingOrgName == "ESRC",]), big.mark = ",")` correspond to ESRC awards.

# Overall expenditure

## Expenditure for all UKRI projects

Expenditure for the whole period under consideration is shown in the graph below. Awards that do not have a value defined have been removed.

```{r funding_ByOrg, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Expenditure across all UKRI councils from the available data."}

gtrdat %>% filter(!is.na(AwardPounds))                                   %>% 
           select(FundingOrgName, AwardPounds)                           %>% 
           group_by(FundingOrgName)                                      %>% 
           summarise(TotalExpenditure = round(sum(AwardPounds)/1000000)) %>% 
           filter(!is.na(TotalExpenditure))                              %>% 
           ggplot(aes(x = FundingOrgName, y = TotalExpenditure)) + 
           geom_col(colour="black",fill="red") +
           xlab("Funding Organisation") + 
           ylab("Expenditure (in million of pounds)") +
           theme_bw() + scale_y_log10()
          
```

## Expenditure for active UKRI projects only 

The graph below only contains values for currently active projects:

```{r funding_ByOrg_active, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Expenditure across all UKRI councils for active projects from the available data."}

gtrdat %>% filter(Status == "Active" & !is.na(AwardPounds))              %>% 
           select(FundingOrgName, AwardPounds)                           %>% 
           group_by(FundingOrgName)                                      %>% 
           summarise(TotalExpenditure = round(sum(AwardPounds)/1000000)) %>% 
           filter(!is.na(TotalExpenditure))                              %>% 
           ggplot(aes(x = FundingOrgName, y = TotalExpenditure)) + 
           geom_col(colour="black",fill="red") +
           xlab("Funding Organisation") + 
           ylab("Expenditure (in million of pounds)") +
           theme_bw() + scale_y_log10()
          
```

# ESRC data

## Project category awards

### All projects category awards

The project categories for the ESRC awards covering the period `r format(min(esrcdat$StartDate),"%d/%m/%y")` to `r format(max(esrcdat$EndDate, na.rm = TRUE),"%d/%m/%y")`. No explicit data seems to be provided for *Studentships*.

```{r esrc_categories, echo = FALSE}

# Look at the project categories
esrcdat %>% select(ProjectCategory, AwardPounds)                           %>% 
            group_by(ProjectCategory)                                      %>% 
            summarise(Number = n(), TotalAward = sum(AwardPounds))         %>% 
            mutate(AverageAward = round(TotalAward/Number,2))              %>% 
            arrange(desc(AverageAward))                                    %>% 
            mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ format(., big.mark = ","))) %>% 
            kbl(format="pipe", align = c("l",rep("r",3)), 
                col.names = c("Project Catgeory", "Number of Awards", 
                                "Total Awarded (£)","Average Award (£)")) 
```

### Active projects categry awards only

This information corresponds to projects that are classified as *Active*.

```{r esrc_categories_active, echo = FALSE}

# Look at the project categories
esrcdat %>% filter(Status == "Active")                                     %>% 
            select(ProjectCategory, AwardPounds)                           %>% 
            group_by(ProjectCategory)                                      %>% 
            summarise(Number = n(), TotalAward = sum(AwardPounds))         %>% 
            mutate(AverageAward = round(TotalAward/Number,2))              %>% 
            arrange(desc(AverageAward))                                    %>% 
            mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ format(., big.mark = ","))) %>% 
            kbl(format="pipe", align = c("l",rep("r",3)), 
                col.names = c("Project Catgeory", "Number of Awards", 
                                "Total Awarded (£)","Average Award (£)")) 

```

## Award length distribution

### Award length distribution for all projects

The award length distribution of the award lengths binned into 28-day periods is shown below. 

```{r award_lengths, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Histogram of the length distribution for all projects."}

# The as.numeric() is a workaround for https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/1377
esrcdat %>% select(StartDate, EndDate, ProjectCategory) %>% 
            filter(!is.na(StartDate) & !is.na(EndDate)) %>% 
            mutate(grant_length = difftime(EndDate, StartDate,units = "days")) %>% 
            ggplot(aes(x = as.numeric(grant_length), fill = ProjectCategory)) + 
            geom_histogram(binwidth = 28, colour="black") + 
            ylab("Number of Awards") + xlab("Award Length (days)") +
            labs(fill = "Project Category") + theme_bw()
```

### Award length distribuion for active projects only

The same information as provided above but only for *Active* projects. The maximum funding period corresponds to `r as.numeric(max(difftime(esrcdat[["EndDate"]][esrcdat$Status == "Active"], esrcdat[["StartDate"]][esrcdat$Status == "Active"], units = "days")))` days.

```{r award_lengths_active, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Histogram of the length distribution for active projects only."}

# The as.numeric() is a workaround for https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/1377
esrcdat %>% filter(Status == "Active")                                          %>% 
            select(StartDate, EndDate, ProjectCategory)                         %>% 
            filter(!is.na(StartDate) & !is.na(EndDate))                         %>% 
            mutate(grant_length = difftime(EndDate, StartDate,units = "days")) %>% 
            ggplot(aes(x = as.numeric(grant_length), fill = ProjectCategory)) + 
            geom_histogram(binwidth = 28, colour="black") + 
            ylab("Number of Awards") + xlab("Award Length (days)") +
            labs(fill = "Project Category") + theme_bw()
```

The top length of awards lie by project category in days is tabulated below.

```{r award_lengths_active_table, echo = FALSE}

esrcdat %>% filter(Status == "Active")                                                      %>% 
            select(StartDate, EndDate, ProjectCategory)                                     %>% 
            filter(!is.na(StartDate) & !is.na(EndDate))                                     %>% 
            mutate(grant_length = as.numeric(difftime(EndDate, StartDate,units = "days")))  %>% 
            group_by(grant_length, ProjectCategory)                                         %>% 
            tally()                                                                         %>% 
            arrange(desc(n))                                                                %>% 
            head(15)                                                                        %>% 
            kbl(format="pipe", align = c("r","l","r"), 
                col.names = c("Number of days","Project Category","Number of projects"))
```

Percentage of award types by time length.

```{r award_lengths_active_fill, echo = FALSE}

# The as.numeric() is a workaround for https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/1377
esrcdat %>% filter(Status == "Active")                                          %>% 
            select(StartDate, EndDate, ProjectCategory)                         %>% 
            filter(!is.na(StartDate) & !is.na(EndDate))                         %>% 
            mutate(grant_length = difftime(EndDate, StartDate,units = "days")) %>% 
            ggplot(aes(x = as.numeric(grant_length), fill = ProjectCategory)) + 
            geom_histogram(binwidth = 28, colour="black", position="fill", na.rm = TRUE) + 
            ylab("Number of Awards") + xlab("Award Length (days)") +
            labs(fill = "Project Category") + theme_bw() + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)
```
## Geographical distribution of awards

### All projects

The expenditure of the awards over the whole time period by region ordered by the total award given is shown in the table below.

```{r esrc_byRegions, echo = FALSE}

esrcdat %>% select(Region, AwardPounds)                                    %>% 
            group_by(Region)                                               %>% 
            summarise(Number = n(), TotalAward = sum(AwardPounds))         %>% 
            mutate(AverageAward = round(TotalAward/Number,2))              %>% 
            arrange(desc(TotalAward))                                      %>% 
            mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ format(., big.mark = ","))) %>% 
            kbl(format="pipe", align = c("l",rep("r",3)),
                col.names = c("Region", "Number of Awards", "Total Awarded (£)","Average Award (£)")) 
```

### Active projects

We can generate the table for projects that are currently active ordered by the total award given is shown in the table below.

```{r esrc_byRegions_active, echo = FALSE}

esrcdat %>% filter(Status == "Active")                                     %>% 
            select(Region, AwardPounds)                                    %>% 
            group_by(Region)                                               %>% 
            summarise(Number = n(), TotalAward = sum(AwardPounds))         %>% 
            mutate(AverageAward = round(TotalAward/Number,2))              %>% 
            arrange(desc(TotalAward))                                      %>% 
            mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ format(., big.mark = ","))) %>% 
            kbl(format="pipe", align = c("l",rep("r",3)),
                col.names = c("Region", "Number of Awards", "Total Awarded (£)","Average Award (£)")) 
```


## Funding by lead organisation

### All projects

This only shows the top 25 organisations by the average value of the award.
 
```{r AwardByOrg, echo = FALSE}

esrcdat %>% select(LeadROName, AwardPounds)                                     %>%

            kbl(format="pipe", align = c("l",rep("r",3)),
                col.names = c("Org", "Number of Awards", "Total Awarded (£)","Average Award (£)")) 
```

### Active projects
This only shows the top 25 organisations with active projects by the average value of the award.
 
```{r ActiveAwardByOrg, echo = FALSE}

### All projects

There are `r length(unique(esrcdat[["Department"]]))` unique departments. The table below only shows departments that have 30 or more occurrences. The Departments below have been 'cleaned' to remove minor differences, e.g. Cardiff Business School to Business School and so on.

```{r departments, echo = FALSE}

N <- nrow(esrcdat)

esrcdat %>% select(CleanDep)                 %>% 
            group_by(CleanDep)               %>% 
            tally()                          %>%
            mutate(Percent=round(n/N*100,2)) %>% 
            arrange(desc(n))                 %>% 
            filter(n >= 30)                  %>% 
            kbl(format="pipe", align = c("l","r","r"),
                col.names = c("Department", "Number", "Percent")) 

```


### Active projects 

There are `r length(unique(esrcdat[["Department"]][esrcdat$Status == "Active"]))` unique departments for active projects (`r length(unique(esrcdat[["Department"]]))` for all projects). The table below only shows cases that have 30 or more occurrences in active projects.

```{r active_departments, echo = FALSE}

N <- nrow(esrcdat[esrcdat$Status =="Active",])

esrcdat %>% filter(Status == "Active")       %>% 
            select(CleanDep)                 %>% 
            group_by(CleanDep)               %>% 
            tally()                          %>%
            mutate(Percent=round(n/N*100,2)) %>% 
            arrange(desc(n))                 %>% 
            filter(n >= 30)                  %>% 
            kbl(format="pipe", align = c("l","r","r"),
                col.names = c("Department", "Number", "Percent")) 
```

## Doctoral Training Partnerships

### Active Partnerships

Currently active doctoral partnerships:

```{r active_DTPs, echo = FALSE}

esrcdat %>% filter(Status == "Active")                                   %>%  
            filter(grepl("Doctoral Training",Title, ignore.case = TRUE)) %>% 
            select(LeadROName, Department, StartDate, EndDate, AwardPounds) %>%
            arrange(StartDate) %>% 
            mutate(across(where(is.Date), ~ format(., "%d/%m/%y"))) %>% 
            mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ format(., big.mark = ","))) %>% 
            kable(format="pipe", align= c("l","l","l","l","r"), 
                  col.names = c("Lead Organisation", "Department","Start", "End","Award (£)")) 
```

# ToDo Items

- [X] Department text needs some cleaning.
- [X] Fix ToC, links do not work.
      Auto-numbering the sections was breaking the ToC links.
- [ ] Add ALT tags to images.
- [ ] Research title looks interesting for further examination but will require processing to be comprehensible.
