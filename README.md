# Software for Social Sciences Data

This is a repository for a UKRI Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) funded project to understand the software used to analyse social sciences data. 

This is done by:

* Desk research which is examining prior related work and a look at the size of the community by looking at [Gateway to Reserach](https://gtr.ukri.org/) which details work funded by the UK Research Councils (our interest clearly lies with the ESRC) and data from [HESA](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/).
* A survey sampling the views and software in the community. The JISC [Online surveys](https://www.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/) was used to this end. A pdf copy of the survey used is available here: [esrc-survey.pdf](Docs/esrc-survey.pdf).
* A set of interviews with members from the community.

Any software produced is made available under a BSD 2-Clause licence and any data and other non-software derivative is made available under a CC-BY 4.0 International Licence.

Exceptions to this are:

* Data from the UKRI ESRC is mostly made available under an [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) Licence.
* Data from Gateway to Research is made available under an [Open Government Licence](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).
