# Software for Social Sciences Data

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/407500828.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/407500828)

This is a repository for a UKRI Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) funded project to understand the software used to analyse social sciences data. 

This is done by:

* Desk research which is examining prior related work and a look at the size of the community by looking at [Gateway to Research](https://gtr.ukri.org/) which details work funded by the UK Research Councils (our interest clearly lies with the ESRC) and data from [HESA](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/).
* A survey sampling the views and software in the community. The JISC [Online surveys](https://www.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/) was used to this end. A pdf copy of the survey used is available here: [esrc-survey.pdf](Docs/esrc-survey.pdf).
* A set of interviews with members from the community.
