# Interview Topic Guide

The script below was used to guide the interview through the process.


## Researcher

Thank you for joining us today. Can you hear me? We are going to record this session, and as we need to record your verbal consent, **ask for consent to record and then start the recording**. The recording will be used to create a pseudonymised transcript. 

So today, we’re going to have a 45 minute conversation, which will take us through to [time now   + 45mins]. **_Ask if the participant has any time constraints_**. 

Hopefully, you have some idea of what we will cover from our previous communication, but just to go over it: first of all, we will ensure we have your consent to collect data; then we will dive straight into the questions about data and software -  what you are using, what kind of workflows you are creating, how you are acquiring training and what the key barriers to software use are, and what support you receive from your institution and ESRC, as appropriate. OK with that?

Obviously, we would like to thank you for your participation today, and we’ll email you a Love2Shop voucher for £50 in the next couple of weeks.  


## Consent 

We’re going to collect your consent verbally today. I’m going to read some statements and if you are happy to give your consent, please just say yes after each statement. If you’re not happy at any point, you can say no and withdraw from the interview. Please do ask if you’re not clear on any of the consent statements. We have six statements, because we need you to consent to both current and future use.  

1. You should have received a copy of the [participant information sheet](https://uoe.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/ESRC-Software-Study/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BAE2BC074-9B2D-4377-8831-13B6285E8BC0%7D&file=ESRC%20study%20participant%20information%20sheet.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) and a [consent form](https://uoe.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/ESRC-Software-Study/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BBF0AF8FA-4387-4DA9-A8CB-B2B9283F4947%7D&file=ESRC%20study%20interview%20participant%20consent%20form.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) with your original email. The first statement is that **_you have read and understood the participant information sheet and have had the opportunity to ask questions about the study_**.  
* Can you indicate verbally that you agree or identify if you don't 

2. The next statement is that **_you agree to take part in this research project and that you agree for your data to be used for the purpose of this study_**. 
* Can you indicate verbally that you agree or identify if you don't 

3. Now we ask you to state that**_ you give permission for the pseudonymised transcript of this interview to be deposited in the researcher’s data space (UoE SharePoint) and repository (DataShare) as described in the Participant Information Sheet so it can be used for future ethically approved research and learning on the Economics and Social Sciences research community. This is so there is explicit consent for the data to be reused. _**
* Can you indicate verbally that you agree or identify if you don't 

4. The next statement is, **_you understand your participation is voluntary and you can withdraw (at any time) for any reason without my participation rights being affected._** 
* Can you indicate verbally that they agree or identify if they don't 

5. The next statement is related, which is that **_you understand that you can withdraw from this study up to a week after the date of the interview. You understand that should you withdraw from the study after this date, then the information collected about you up to this point may still be used for the purposes of achieving the objectives of the study only_**. 
* Can you indicate verbally that you agree or identify if you don't  

6. Next, **_you understand that you may be quoted directly in reports of the research but that you will not be directly identified (e.g. that your name will not be used and identifiable details will be changed)_**.  
* Can you indicate verbally that you agree or identify if you don't 


## Interview

Can you briefly state your background, your discipline and your (or your group’s) research interests in particular what data sets and software are used.

Might want to ask at the end, has this interview made you think about your own practice in any way?

Are there any things you think the ESRC should be made aware of regarding software?
